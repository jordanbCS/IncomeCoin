The current thinking is that IncomeCoins will be minted and "paid" out to wallets proportionally to a paired BasicIncomeCoin wallet. Unlike BasicIncomeCoin tokens however, IncomeCoins would not be intended to be a store of value, but rather serve as the "evidence" needed to mint tokens for IdentityCoin which in turn are spent on weighting transfers made by VoteCoin wallets. The intuition is that a set of of intermediary coins is needed in order to solve some of the problems that come up with BasicIncomeCoin and VoteCoin.
